# Complete Playwright + TypeScript Monorepo Setup Summary

## 1. Initialize your project:
npm init -y

2. Install Playwright test runner, TypeScript, and ts-node:
npm install -D @playwright/test typescript ts-node

3. Install Playwright browsers:
npx playwright install

4. Create TypeScript config:
npx tsc --init

5. Create playwright.config.ts
Create a file named playwright.config.ts in your root folder with the following content:

import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'website1',
      testDir: './e2e-projects/website1/specs',
    },
    // Add more projects here as needed
  ],
  use: {
    headless: false,
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
});

6. Add test script to package.json:
Make sure your package.json includes this under scripts:

"scripts": {
  "test": "playwright test"
}

8. Recommended folder structure:

Playwright/
 ├─ e2e-projects/
 │   ├─ website1/
 │   │   ├─ scripts/
 │   │   ├─ specs/
 │   │   └─ utils/

 │       └─ utils/
 ├─ node_modules/
 ├─ package.json
 ├─ playwright.config.ts
 ├─ tsconfig.json
 └─ README.md

9. Run your tests
npm test
# or
npx playwright test
